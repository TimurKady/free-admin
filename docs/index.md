# FreeAdmin Documentation

*Modular admin panel for FastAPI and Tortoise ORM*

---

## Introduction

FreeAdmin is a modern, extensible admin panel for FastAPI. Inspired by Django Admin, it provides CRUD, configuration, and custom views through a Bootstrap 5 frontend and JSON-Schema forms.
It is designed to be **ORM-agnostic**, starting with Tortoise ORM support.

## Key Features

* Three operation modes: **ORM CRUD**, **system configuration**, and **custom views** (Bootstrap 5 cards with HTML).
* JSON-Schema based forms with [JSON-Editor](https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor).
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions.
* Import/Export wizard (Excel and other formats).
* Extensible widget system and inline editing.
* CLI tools for scaffolding and admin management.
* Modular adapter architecture for future ORM support.
